# My website

Look upon this repository's history with awe and marvel at the sleepless nights I've had as I've worked on this thing. Looking at the commit history for this repository reveals the nights that I didn't get any sleep; just look for a series of commits that starts sometime in the late evening and ends sometime in the early morning. But hey, my website looks fantastic, so... I guess it was worth it?
