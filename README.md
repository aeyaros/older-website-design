# Andrew Yaros's Personal Webiste

Look upon this repository's history with awe and marvel at the sleepless nights I've had as I've worked on this thing. Looking at the commit history for this repository reveals the nights that I didn't get any sleep; just look for a series of commits starting sometime in the late evening and ending the morning after. But hey, my website looks fantastic, so... I guess it was worth it?

Remember that you can view the repository history in the console with the "git log" command.
